3. Place the project files in the web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

4. Set up a MySQL database for user authentication (optional: if your `auth.php` and `register.php` scripts require database interaction).

5. Access the website via a web browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/[project_folder]/index.php
   ```
